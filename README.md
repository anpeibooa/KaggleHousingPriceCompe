# KaggleHousingPriceCompe
My first attempt of a kaggle competition. This version is a refined version after a brute force solution. 
The brute force solution achieved a score of 0.167ish on the test set while the refined version achieved 0.146ish to 0.155ish depending on my luck.
I did some searches on model improvement and found that using stacking and blending is really beneficial. However, this repo is about my own approach to the problem so I will not apply what I learned from other authors.
